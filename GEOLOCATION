You must enable Location Services to run GNOME Voice.

To enable Location Services in GNOME 43, navigate to the Settings app
and choose Privacy/Location Services and make sure Location Services
is checked.

Alternatively, run the following command in a GNOME Terminal Console:

    gsettings set org.gnome.system.location enabled true
